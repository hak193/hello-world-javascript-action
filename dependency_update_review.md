# Dependency Update Review

## Updated Dependencies
1. @eslint/compat: 1.2.5 -> 1.2.6
2. @github/local-action: 2.5.1 -> 2.6.2
3. eslint: 9.19.0 -> 9.20.1
4. prettier: 3.4.2 -> 3.5.1
5. rollup: 4.32.0 -> 4.34.8

## Potential Impact
These are all minor version updates, which generally indicate bug fixes and non-breaking changes. However, it's recommended to review the changelogs of each package for any significant changes.

## Recommendations
1. Run the full test suite to ensure compatibility with the updated dependencies.
2. Perform a local build to check for any unexpected issues.
3. After merging, monitor the application closely in staging/pre-production environments.
4. Review the eslint and prettier configurations to ensure they're still valid with the new versions.

## Conclusion
This update appears to be low-risk, focusing on development dependencies. No critical issues are apparent, but thorough testing is advised before merging to production.
